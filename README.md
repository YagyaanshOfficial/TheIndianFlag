# TheIndianFlag
Hello, everyone! This is the first ever code written by me.
I decided to do this project for the upcoming occasion of independence day on 15th August 2019.
I invite everybody to help me make this code more efficient. 
P.S. I know there is a more efficient way of drawing the spokes using turtle.goto() and i hope to update it soon.
